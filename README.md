## Overview

Welcome to the repository for **Contrasting Historical and Physical Perspectives in Asymmetric Catalysis**. This project presents a detailed examination of asymmetric catalysis, contrasting traditional quantitative structure-activity relationship approaches with machine learning methods. Designed for researchers, students, and professionals in the field, this repository serves as a supplementary resource for understanding both the historical evolution and the current state-of-the-art in asymmetric catalysis.

## Background

Asymmetric catalysis is a cornerstone of modern chemistry, enabling the selective production of chiral moleculesâ€”a critical aspect in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and beyond. This project delves into the historical context, tracing the development of key concepts and techniques, while also presenting contemporary methodologies grounded in physical principles.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prs-group/Contrasting-Historical-and-Physical-Perspectives-in-Asymmetric-Catalysis.git
cd Contrasting-Historical-and-Physical-Perspectives-in-Asymmetric-Catalysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to have Python 3.7+ installed. If you need to set up a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

## Usage

This repository is modular, allowing you to use each component independently or together as part of a larger analysis pipeline.

### Data Preprocessing
```bash
python data_preprocessing.py --input your_data.csv --output preprocessed_data.csv
```

### Model Training
```bash
python train_val.py --config config.yaml --data preprocessed_data.csv
```

### Hyperparameter Optimization
```bash
python hpo.py --config config.yaml --trials 100
```
